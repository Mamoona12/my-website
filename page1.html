      <p class="card-text">Most of the time, we assume that we have a lot of time. And for that reason, we delay doing our works or wait for the so-called right time.<br><br>
         However, the fact is we don’t always have enough time. If you are passionate enough about your goals and success, you must start right now. Or else, there is a possibility that it will be too late. And that, you have to regret for the rest of your life.<br><br>
          Well, we can understand that sometimes, the initial effort is pretty tough. But, to witness the desired achievement, you have to start right now. Well, the best thing that you can do is to live an active life.<br><br> Most of the time, we become lazy towards our initial efforts, because we are living a pretty laid-back life. So, start today by changing your lifestyle. And soon you will find out that you are closer to your objective.<br><br>If you think that you will accomplish your goal later, you are living in a wrong notion. There is nothing called ‘later.’ If you surrender your future to ‘later,’ you can never reach your desired goal. So, start right now and convert it into the best time.  </p>
