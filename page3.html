      <p class="card-text">We know that emotional attachment is a beautiful thing. Nothing can be better than attaching with a person emotionally. But sometimes, that emotional attachment becomes baggage. We start to expect a lot from the people sitting on the other side.<br><br> And after that, we become emotionally dependent on those people. And if we don’t get the desired reciprocation, we become sad and break. So, the fundamental thing that you must consider is that you have to do everything on your own.<br><br> No one else is going to do the things for you. You will be in charge of making your decisions. Do not let anyone manipulate your choices. And, you have to push yourself to the edge, as no one is going to do it for you, it’s your life and it’s your success journey. <br><br>Once you push yourself towards the corner, you will get the results of your desire. Also, by promoting yourself, you can transform into a better human. And, it will help you to learn a lot of lessons about life, which no one can teach you.</p>
