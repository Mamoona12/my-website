      <p class="card-text">Every person in this world must learn to give without any expectation. Expecting gratification or acknowledgment after giving something to others means we are not really giving with a full heart.<br><br>  You must learn to think that you have an abundance of everything, and after giving others, you will still have plenty for yourself.<br><Br>  It will help you give more to people who do not have anything. This will also give you peace of mind, and your heart will be filled with happiness. With your simple kind gesture, you can make someone elseâ€™s life better.<br><br> However, if you start expecting back from others or if you have a selfish reason to give, it will make you very narrow-minded, and you can never feel the perfect happiness of giving without any reason.</p>
